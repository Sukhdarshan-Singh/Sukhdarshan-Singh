## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a Software Engineering student who enjoys working across the stack — from **low-level systems and embedded software** to **full-stack web applications**.

Most of my larger projects are **collaborative, team-based university projects**, developed within GitHub organizations (coursework, robotics teams, aerospace and rover competitions). I care about writing clean code, understanding systems deeply, and communicating clearly within a team.
